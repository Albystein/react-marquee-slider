$ cd example && yarn
$ yarn start
```

Go to http://localhost:8000

## Intro

A marquee slider, that can randomly position child elements in the container. This is absolutely WIP. You'll need to have a look into the code to understand how to use and what's going on.

## Installation

```
$ yarn add react-marquee
$ yarn add lodash classnames # install peer dependencies
```

## Features

- Finally you can generate random but uniformly distributed elements in a container.
- High performance. Utilizes CSS animations where possible.
